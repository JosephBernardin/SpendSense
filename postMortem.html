                            <h4>How did the project change from your initial vision or stories? Did it work out as predicted?</h4>
                            <p>
                                The project changed significantly over time, especially when we realized just how much we overpromised.  Many features like dark mode, collaboration and budgets were not reachable due to time constraints. However, features that we were able to get too, went as intended, such as tracking income, expenses and savings goals. Although, some features that would closely work with them were also unfortunately scraped due to time constraints, features like notifications and graphs for things like savings goals. In conclusion, visions and stories that we did get too all worked out as predicted, however we did have to abandon many of vision or stories due to time constraints.

                            <h4>What did we learn about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep doing, or stop doing next time?</h4>
                            <p>
                                We have learned just how much we tend to overpromise in large project development, how much longer feedback and bug changes take in comparison to normal assignments and just how helpful teammates are teammates. We will start focusing more on SOLID principles so we can cut down on time we would spend on fixing bugs and feedback. We will keep up our high communication through discord and teamwork in both online and in person meetings. One thing we will stop doing next time is overpromising.

                            <p>
                                We can conclude that SOLID principle violations are rather tricky, whether it be intentional or accidental they tend to pop up in large scale projects, not to mention the time it takes to figure out how to fix it and then actually do the fixing. Another conclusion we found is that the implementing a proper persistence layer was very difficult, we spend days in a cat and mouse chase (literally since we were using logcat) to figure out how to fix our scripts and logs to make sure transactions were persisting and not effecting others.

                            <h4>Iteration 2 Retrospective - Area For Improvement</h4>
                            <p>
                                In our iteration 2 retrospective we identified communication as the key area for improvement. Specifically identifying the following as ways to communicate more effectively:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Discuss our goals in this iteration as time estimates get closer</li>
                                    <li>Identifying issues early, include one person from the group who wrote the code so there is no overlap or need to rewrite code</li>
                                    <li>Communicating proactively about progress of a current branch</li>
                                    <li>Recording what exactly was done to the branch for ease of transition</li>
                                    <li>Plan the commits and creation of branches more before pushing to GitLab</li>
                                </ul>
                                To communicate more effectively in iteration 3, we made sure to have more frequent meetings and have those meetings early on to identify the work that needs to be done. Also, we made sure to inform everyone of the changes we were making on each branch so that everyone knew where they'd be picking up when they checked out the branch.
